# 🚢 Titanic Survival Analysis

This project is an end-to-end data analysis of the Titanic dataset. The goal is to explore how different passenger attributes influenced survival outcomes and to extract meaningful insights through visualization and statistics.

---

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)
- **Target Variable**: `Survived` (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

---

## ✅ Objectives

- Understand the structure of the dataset
- Clean and preprocess the data
- Analyze survival trends across various features
- Visualize key insights
- Generate a basic understanding of what factors mattered most in survival

---

## 📊 Key Explorations

- Gender-wise survival analysis
- Class-wise (Pclass) comparison
- Age group survival trends
- Family size impact (SibSp + Parch)
- Embarked port and Fare correlations

---

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python** (Jupyter Notebook)
- `pandas` for data manipulation  
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualization  
- Basic Python functions for data wrangling and transformation

---

## 📌 Notable Insights

- **Females** had a significantly higher survival rate compared to males.
- **1st Class passengers** had a better chance of survival than those in 2nd or 3rd class.
- Passengers who **paid higher fares** and those who **embarked from Cherbourg** had better survival chances.
- The **age distribution** showed children had higher survival rates compared to older adults.

---

## 🚀 Future Work

- Apply machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree)
- Feature engineering (e.g., extract titles from names)
- Build a survival prediction system
